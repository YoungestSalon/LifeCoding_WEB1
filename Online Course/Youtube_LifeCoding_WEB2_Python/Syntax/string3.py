And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler'''+age+''' and '''+name2+''', long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; '''+name+'''
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day! '''+name2+'''!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood and '''+name3+''', and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.''')
